# Game-Schedule-Generator
A program that will generate a game schedule for a league based on dates, number of teams, number of games, and other parameters. At the end you can export the schedule as a .csv or .xlsx.

This generator is good besides two flaws that I have been unable to figure out solutions to.

Flaws:
  1) Having each team only play once on a given date.
  2) Schedule will only work for an even number of games, and cannot handle schedule repeat matchups (can't have more games than there are number of teams)
  
  
If you think that you could help me solve these problems with this generator, I would be very appreciative. I will be looking at how to solve it in my freetime.
